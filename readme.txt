This plugin allows you to do video posts and accept video comments.

== Description ==

You can use this plugin to spice up your blog with video posts. Simply start by creating a new post,
click on the `Record Video` button and take a video of yourself. It'll then be shown to your audience
once your post goes live.

You can also invite people to leave video comments. Folks will have the option to either leave a traditional
text comment or take a short video of themselves that'll be viewable by everybody on your site.

The plugin is based on the Ziggeo API which allows you to integrate video recording and playback with only
two lines of code in your site, service or app. 


== Installation ==

Upload the directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory and click on `Ziggeo Video` in the settings menu.

If you experience any issues with the plugin, please let us know at support@ziggeo.com
